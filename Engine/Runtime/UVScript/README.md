# UVScript

UVScript (`.uvs`) is UniVex's scripting language: one text file per entity node that says what the
node does. It replaced the visual script graph, which was hard to keep in step with the engine
and has been removed.

## What it has to beat

The comparison point is GDScript (Godot 4.x). The weaknesses that shaped UVScript:

| GDScript today | UVScript |
|---|---|
| Typing is optional. Untyped code is slow, because every operation resolves the type at run time. | Every value has a static type. It is inferred when left out (`let n = 3`), and checked before the game runs. |
| Interpreted. Hot loops are about half the speed of C#. | Compiled: a bytecode VM in the editor (instant reload), and C++23 generated from the same bytecode for release builds. |
| No tuples, and no generics on user types. | Tuples (`let (a, b) = pair()`) and typed collections (`list[int]`, `map[str, Object3D]`). |
| Signals are connected by name as strings; typos show up at run time. | Events are blocks (`on body_entered(other):`). The compiler checks the name and the parameters against the node kind. |
| `await` needs a signal or a timer object. | `wait 0.5 s`, `wait until grounded`, `wait next_frame`. The node pauses; nothing is allocated. |
| Numbers carry no units, so seconds vs frames and degrees vs radians get mixed up. | Unit literals (`2 s`, `150 ms`, `90 deg`, `3 m`). Angles are converted to radians at compile time. |
| The built-in editor has no rename refactoring. | Every symbol resolves to one declaration, so the editor can rename safely. The node's own name is a symbol too. |

## A script

```
entity Player : Character3D

export speed: float = 6.0
export jump_height = 1.2 m
var jumps = 0

on ready:
    print("{name} is ready")

on tick(dt):
    let move = input.axis("left", "right")
    velocity.x = move * speed
    if grounded and input.pressed("jump"):
        velocity.y = sqrt(2.0 * gravity * jump_height)
        jumps += 1

on body_entered(other: Object3D):
    wait 0.5 s
    other.hide()

fn heal(amount: int) -> bool:
    health += amount
    return health >= max_health
```

- **`entity Name : Kind`** is the first line. It says which node kind the script drives. Its
  properties (`velocity`, `grounded`, ...) are in scope without `self.`.
- **`export`** shows a field in the Inspector. **`var`** keeps a value between frames. **`let`**
  is a local. **`const`** is fixed at compile time.
- **`on <event>`** runs when the event happens. **`fn`** declares a function.
- Blocks are set by indentation. `#` starts a comment.

## Module

- **What it does:** turns `.uvs` source into a checked tree, then into something that runs.
- **Why it is separate:** it depends on nothing but the standard library, so the language can be
  tested and reused without the engine; the engine plugs in through `UVScriptHostUVE`.
- **Depends on:** nothing but the standard library.
- **Exposes:**
  - `ParseUVScriptUVE` and the AST types in `uvscript_ast_uve.h`;
  - `CompileUVScriptUVE` / `CompileUVScriptSourceUVE`;
  - `ScriptInstanceUVE`;
  - `UVScriptHostUVE`, the interface a node kind implements;
  - `GenerateUVScriptNativeCppUVE` and the native runtime (`uvscript_native_uve.h`);
  - `DescribedHostUVE`, a host read from a `.uvhost` text file, and the `uvsc` tool.

## Status

1. **Lexer and parser.** Indentation, unit literals, string interpolation, the full v1 grammar.
   Diagnostics have line and column, and parsing recovers at the next line.
2. **Checker, compiler and VM (this change).**
   - `CompileUVScriptUVE` checks every name, operator, assignment, return and event against the
     node's host (`UVScriptHostUVE`), then emits stack bytecode.
   - `ScriptInstanceUVE` runs it: handlers, functions, fields, and `wait` that pauses only its own
     handler.
   - A runaway loop is cut off after one million instructions.
   - Not in yet:
     - collections, tuples and `[]`;
     - calling methods on other nodes (`other.hide()`);
     - `wait` inside a `fn`.
3. **Engine binding.** A node whose script slot names a `.uvs` file runs it:
   - `EngineCoreUVE` compiles it once per path against `UVScriptNodeHostUVE`; errors are logged with
     `file:line:column` once, not every frame;
   - `ready` runs once, then `tick(dt)` every frame, in process-priority order, and paused with the
     rest of the simulation; contact edges arrive as `collision_enter/exit` and
     `overlap_enter/exit`, each carrying the other object's name;
   - the host gives `name`, `position`, `scale`, and on a character body `velocity` and
     `grounded`, plus `input.pressed/held/released/axis`; a rigid body adds its own
     `velocity` and `physics.apply_force/apply_impulse/apply_torque(vec3)`; an audio source
     adds `volume`/`pitch` and `audio.play()/audio.stop()/audio.is_playing()`; every object
     gets writable `visible`, lights add `intensity`, cameras add `fov`.
   - a saved edit restarts the script within half a second, and fixing a broken file is enough
     for it to be retried.
4. **Editor.** The Inspector's script slot has **New UVScript**: it writes `scripts/<node>.uvs`
   with an `entity <Node> : <Kind>` header and opens it in the Scripting workspace's text editor,
   which checks the text against the node on every edit and lists problems by line and column.
   - **Exports (this change):** each `export` field shows under the script slot as a control of
     its type (checkbox, number, text, three numbers). The node stores only the values it changes,
     as text in its Script component, so one edit is one undo step; right-clicking a changed name
     resets it. The engine sets them before `ready`, and changing one restarts the script.
   - The node-graph scripting (the old `Scripting` module, its canvas and bridge commands) has
     been removed. A node whose script is not a `.uvs` file logs one warning and does not run.
5. **C++23 output (this change).** `GenerateUVScriptNativeCppUVE` turns a compiled program into C++:
   one function per handler or `fn`, jumps as `goto`, each `wait` as a return that the next call
   resumes from. It calls the same value operations as the interpreter, so results, error text,
   line numbers and the instruction budget are identical; the tests run every script both ways and
   compare. Each file registers itself under the program's fingerprint, and an instance runs native
   code whenever a table for its exact program is linked in, the interpreter otherwise.
   - At build time: `uve_add_uvscript_native(game HOST player.uvhost SCRIPTS player.uvs)` runs
     `uvsc`, which compiles each script against the node described in the `.uvhost` file.
   - From a running game: `EngineCoreUVE::WriteNativeUVScriptsUVE(dir)` writes the C++ of every
     program in use, compiled against the real node, ready to add to the release build.
   - **Typed code (this change).** A function or handler whose stack types are known at every
     instruction, and that has no `wait` and touches no node values, also gets an unboxed twin:
     `int64_t`/`double`/`bool`/`std::string`/`Vec3ValueUVE` locals, direct calls between such
     twins, and the same zero checks, error text and per-instruction budget as the interpreter.
     Anything else keeps the `ValueUVE` form. Arguments handed in from outside (`CallUVE`,
     `RaiseEventUVE`) are checked against the parameter types first, both ways.
   - Measured once, in a Debug build: `fib(20)` took 68.8 ms interpreted and 0.62 ms native. A
     test prints this each run; it is not a benchmark, and Release numbers were not taken.
