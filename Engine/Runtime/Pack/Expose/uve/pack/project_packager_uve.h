/// folder"). No new manifest format is invented: the project's own `.uvproject` package (already
/// real, tested, and now carrying `startupScenePath` - see EditorProjectPackageUVE) is copied
/// verbatim alongside the content it references, so every relative path inside it still resolves
/// unchanged in the copy. The result is directly runnable in place:
/// `<outputDirectory>/uve_runtime --project <outputDirectory>/<projectFile's own filename>`.
///
/// Deliberately out of scope for this minimal pass (stated honestly, not silently dropped): no
/// asset stripping/optimization, no content-database pruning to only-referenced assets, no
/// platform cross-compilation (the copied binary is whatever was already built for the host
/// platform), no installer/archive creation - a plain folder is the deliverable.
