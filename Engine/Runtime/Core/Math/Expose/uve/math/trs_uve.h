/// quaternion/vector arithmetic; this type makes that composition one named operation.
/// A point `p` is transformed as `translation + rotation * (scale * p)` (scale first, then
/// rotation, then translation), matching `Matrix4x4UVE::ComposeTrsUVE` exactly.
/// Deliberately minimal, matching this module's precedent: compose, forward/inverse point and
/// direction transforms, equality, and a debug formatter. There is intentionally NO materialized
/// inverse (`TryInverseUVE` returning a `TrsUVE`): rotation and non-uniform scale do not commute,
/// so the inverse of a general TRS is not itself a TRS — the in-tree precedent is the reparent
/// path refusing non-uniformly-scaled rotated parents, since no local TRS reproduces that world
/// TRS. The `TryInverseTransform*UVE()` functions below are the exact inverse APPLICATION for
/// every scale, which is what every caller actually needs.
