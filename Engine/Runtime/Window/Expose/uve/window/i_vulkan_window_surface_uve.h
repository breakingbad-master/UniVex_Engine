/// Vulkan backend. Consumers (currently only Render::VulkanRenderDeviceUVE, selected by
/// EngineCoreUVE) query it with dynamic_cast<IVulkanWindowSurfaceUVE*>(iWindowManager); a null
/// cast result is the contract's own "Vulkan presentation not possible on this backend" answer —
/// NullWindowManagerUVE deliberately does not implement it, so headless runs never even attempt
/// device creation.
///
/// Opaque-handle discipline: every Vulkan type crossing this boundary travels as a raw
/// std::uintptr_t integer, so this public header names no Vulkan symbol and no GLFW symbol —
/// matching the codebase's third-party-header confinement discipline (the Window module keeps
/// both libraries confined to its implementation files, exactly as it already does for GLFW in
/// IWindowManagerUVE). On Vulkan's interpretation: `vulkanInstance` carries a VkInstance (typedef
/// of a pointer) and CreateVulkanWindowSurfaceUVE returns a VkSurfaceKHR, both round-tripped
/// losslessly through uintptr-sized storage. The Window implementation itself pulls in
/// GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN privately; nothing above it needs that knowledge.
///
/// WindowManagerUVE (the GLFW3 backend) implements all four operations by forwarding to the
/// exact GLFW entry points (glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions, glfwCreateWindowSurface,
/// glfwDestroyWindowSurface, glfwGetFramebufferSize), so its failure modes are GLFW's: extension
/// retrieval or surface creation can legitimately fail on platforms without Vulkan WSI support,
/// and the implementation reports that rather than aborting (see each override's doc comment in
/// window_manager_uve.h).
