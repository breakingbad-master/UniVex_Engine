/// Shift+wheel for horizontal) instead of spilling out. `scrollOffset` is authored and persists -
/// a reopened panel sits where it was left - while `contentSize` is recomputed every frame and
/// never round-trips. The box draws nothing itself; compose an image behind it for a background.

/// Clipping is software: every emitted quad is intersected against its scroll ancestors (nested
/// clips intersect) with texture coordinates remapped, fully-outside quads dropped, and
/// hit-testing gated on the same clips, so no renderer changes were needed. Partially visible
/// widgets still interact - only the pixels (and hover outside the clip) are cut. A scroll
/// container stacks its children itself, so a layout container on the same entity is overridden;
/// scroll containers do not nest (an inner one stacks without ever scrolling), and there is no
/// scrollbar widget yet - wheel only. Thread-safety: value type; trivially safe to copy/move.
