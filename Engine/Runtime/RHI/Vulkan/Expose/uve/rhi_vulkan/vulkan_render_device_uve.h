// VulkanRenderDeviceUVE — the engine's second real IRenderDeviceUVE backend and the milestone-1
// (M1) "bootstrap" of the approved modern-GPU path. M1 scope is
// deliberately narrow and honest: instance -> physical/logical device -> window surface ->
// swapchain -> per-frame clear-color present. Synchronisation is the documented-simple form —
// one frame in flight plus vkQueueWaitIdle before every swapchain teardown call — matching the
// "small real thing over big fake thing" rule that governs this repo's milestone slicing.
//
// Slice M2a ("draw slice") added 2026-09-17: buffers (host-visible memory policy), SPIR-V
// shaders, fixed-function pipelines built on the swapchain render pass, recorded command
// buffers, and Draw/DrawIndexed replay inside the frame pass are all REAL implementations —
// the device renders actual geometry into the presented image, replaying submitted command
// buffers exactly the way GlRenderDeviceUVE plays its recordings.
//
// Slice M2b ("uniforms + depth") added 2026-09-17: SPIRV-Reflect parses each pipeline's
// SPIR-V at creation; set-0 uniform-buffer blocks become dynamic-offset descriptor bindings
// against one shared 1 MiB-per-frame uniform ring (always-snapshot-per-draw, never per-draw
// descriptor writes), push-constant blocks become VkPushConstantRange state, and every
// SetUniform* op resolves by reflected member name into CPU-side shadows that the draw path
// snapshots into the ring. The swapchain render pass grew a real depth attachment
// (D32_SFLOAT preferred, X8_D24 fallback), so depthTestEnabled/depthWriteEnabled are honored
// exactly as GlRenderDeviceUVE documents them (LESS_OR_EQUAL), and the caller's clearDepth
// feeds the frame's depth clear. Still honest "not yet" areas (documented at each method,
// warnings emitted once, no silent lies): textures/images/SSBOs (pipeline creation FAILS
// loudly with an M2c message rather than building a broken layout), more-than-one
// descriptor set, offscreen render targets, loadOp semantics beyond clear, per-op depth
// compare funcs, device-local staging, pipeline binaries. Those keep returning the
// documented invalid/false/empty results with a warning naming the missing milestone.
//
// Slice M2d ("offscreen render targets") added 2026-09-17: BeginRenderPassUVE with texture
// attachments is now REAL on 1.3-capable devices. The engineering shortcut the classic
/// render-pass route could not survive: VkRenderPass compatibility requires EXACT format
// identity per attachment, the swapchain is sRGB-typed, and RHI RGBA8 textures are unorm —
// so the device switches wholesale to core-1.3 dynamic rendering (probed via
// vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 + VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features::dynamicRendering, enabled
// in the device-create feature chain; the instance apiVersion has been clamped at 1.3 since
// bring-up). In dynamic mode there is no VkRenderPass and no framebuffers: pipelines declare
// their one-color(RGBA8)+depth contract through VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo, passes open
// lazily with vkCmdBeginRendering at the first marker of a run, and interleaved
// default/offscreen passes are legal (a re-opened swapchain instance resumes with LOAD —
// GL's FBO semantics preserved exactly). Textures allocate in the swapchain's own format via
// MUTABLE_FORMAT + a color-space-matched SAMPLED view (UNORM for linear, sRGB for decoded color)
// and an image-native ATTACHMENT view, so every RGBA8 texture is attachable by construction;
// color-only offscreen passes borrow an
// extent-keyed scratch depth image; caller Depth32Float textures attach when the device
// depth is D32. Honest boundaries (one-shot warns + skip/degrade, never silent wrong
// pixels): classic-mode devices (no 1.3 entry points) keep byte-identical M2c behavior and
// skip offscreen passes; non-attachable textures (RGBA16Float; anything when the swapchain
// is not a 4x8 RGBA format) skip their pass; D24 devices fall back to the invisible scratch
// depth; sampling a Depth32Float texture is the M2e slice and returns the 1x1 white
// fallback until then. The latent M1 readback-fence hazard is fixed here too: the readback
// submission rides its own transient fence created around it (the presented-frame fence is
// strictly PresentUVE-owned).
//
// Slice M2f ("SSBOs + separate samplers") added 2026-09-18: CreatePipelineUVE reflection now
// accepts STORAGE_BUFFER bindings (bound through the new ICommandBufferUVE::BindStorageBufferUVE
// — GL shader-storage binding-point semantics, i-th reflected storage binding reads global slot
// i) and separate SAMPLED_IMAGE + SAMPLER pairs (fed from the same BindTextureUVE slots as
// combined samplers; every standalone SAMPLER binding is written with ONE device-owned fixed
// sampler — the RHI's single GL-mirrored linear/trilinear/clamp shape, bounded by the image view).
// Storage buffers live in
// real per-handle VkBuffers (the M2a host-visible policy), join the per-tuple descriptor-set
// cache under an 's'-prefixed key section, and are invalidated from it at DestroyBufferUVE
// exactly like textures. Unbound or destroyed-after-bind storage slots read a device-owned
// zero-filled fallback buffer — deterministic zeros, the buffer analogue of the 1x1 white
// fallback texture. Storage IMAGES (and any other descriptor type) still fail pipeline creation
// loudly: they land with the compute milestone (ComputeSystemUVE, Part 7.2). External uniform
// buffers (BindUniformBufferUVE) remain the documented later-slice no-op; SetUniform* + the
// reflected ring is the uniform path.
//
// Slice M3 ("device-local staging") added 2026-09-18: VERTEX and INDEX buffers now allocate
// DEVICE_LOCAL memory (the performance shape M2a's host-visible policy explicitly deferred)
// and carry TRANSFER_DST; their initial data and every UpdateBufferUVE re-stage through a
// one-shot staging copy that mirrors the M2c texture-upload discipline exactly — transient
// HOST_VISIBLE|COHERENT TRANSFER_SRC buffer, one-time command buffer on the present queue,
// buffer barriers around vkCmdCopyBuffer (TRANSFER_WRITE published to VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE_READ /
// INDEX_READ), full-idle wait before teardown. UNIFORM buffers stay HOST_VISIBLE with the
// persistent map (host writes ARE the SetUniform ring mechanism) and STORAGE buffers stay
// host-visible in this slice (SSBO traffic benefits least from device placement; the M2f
// zero-fallback contract is untouched). The caller-visible copy-on-update contract is
// identical for every usage — only placement/traffic differs. The memory policy is
// arm-independent (both classic and dynamic devices get device-local vertex/index buffers);
// the reported name follows the established rule that the badge tracks the newest slice.
//
// Slice M4 ("parallel recording") added 2026-09-18: multi-threaded command recording is a
// real, contract-documented capability. VulkanCommandBufferUVE objects carry NO device state
// (recording appends to a per-object retained list), so any number of threads may create,
// record, and submit their own command buffers concurrently; SubmitUVE() pushes into a
// mutex-guarded submission FIFO from any thread, and PresentUVE() drains that FIFO into a
// local snapshot under the same lock before replaying strictly main-thread (the GPU timeline
// keeps one owner; a submit racing a present lands in the NEXT frame's FIFO — honest queue
// order). Replay stays the M2a one-primary-buffer model: this slice parallelizes RECORDING
// (the explicit-API capability the roadmap names), not the replay translation. Resource
// creation/destruction and PresentUVE remain main-thread calls.
//
// Slice M5a ("compute dispatch") added 2026-09-18: CreateComputePipelineUVE() builds real
// VkPipelines at the COMPUTE bind point (compact compute-only SPIR-V reflection: uniform
// blocks flow through the M2b ring-dynamic machinery, STORAGE_BUFFER slots through the M2f
// slot/tuple-cache machinery; every other descriptor form refuses loudly — storage images
// name the M5b slice), and ICommandBufferUVE::DispatchUVE() replays OUTSIDE render-pass
// markers as Vulkan requires: the handler closes any lazily-open dynamic-rendering instance
// first (a later Begin re-opens it with LOAD, content preserved), brackets vkCmdDispatch in
// conservative global memory barriers (prior shader writes visible to compute; compute
// writes visible to every later shader reader and the queue-idle readback), and flushes
// descriptors at the COMPUTE bind point. The classic pre-1.3 arm cannot dispatch at all —
// its whole replay is wrapped in ONE native render pass instance where compute is illegal —
// so it warns once and skips (bit 19); draws reaching replay with a compute pipeline bound
// skip warn-once too (bit 20). The replay's outside-pass ignore rule now relaxes while a
// compute pipeline is bound (outside-pass storage binds and uniform writes are the dispatch
// feed).
//
// Slice M5b ("storage images") added 2026-09-18: STORAGE_IMAGE descriptors are accepted by
// BOTH pipeline reflections (the M2f loud refusal is lifted) and join the ONE texture-slot
// space — the pipeline's i-th texture-family binding (sampled and storage forms together,
// ascending by binding number) reads global BindTextureUVE slot i. Storage slots write
// STORAGE_IMAGE descriptors with VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL: the first tuple-set write
// transitions the texture to GENERAL (a legal — if unoptimal — sampling and attachment-entry
// layout, so it becomes the texture's permanent rest state; CloseCurrentPassDynamicUVE
// restores pinned offscreen attachments to GENERAL instead of SHADER_READ_ONLY). The
// transition barrier is only legal OUTSIDE a rendering instance, so the flush closes an open
// pass and reopens it with LOAD semantics (content preserved) around the barrier — on the
// classic pre-1.3 arm, whose single native pass spans the whole replay, storage-image draws
// warn once (bit 22) and skip. Cached descriptor sets that baked the pre-pin layout are
// invalidated at pin time and park in a deferred-free list (this frame's recorded binds may
// still reference them; the next PresentUVE's post-fence point frees them). Depth textures
// are never storage-bound: such slots deterministically write a device-owned 1x1 black sink
// (bit 21) — imageStore into the shared white sampling fallback would corrupt its invariant,
// and unbound/destroyed storage-image slots resolve to the same sink. Sampled descriptors of
// a GENERAL-pinned texture rewrite with the GENERAL layout so cached sets never contradict
// the tracked state. The M5a dispatch post-barrier widened to also publish compute writes to
// COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT (a storage-written texture may be ATTACHED with Load next).
// Same-day fix-forward on the slice's first red CI: the IMAGE side of the contract —
// storage descriptors written against images created without VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT,
// and through views whose format cannot match a SPIR-V image-format qualifier, are
// undefined behavior that segfaulted lavapipe at execution in all three pixel proofs.
// Every color texture now carries VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT (depth textures never
// storage-bind — the sink substitution stands), and RGBA8 textures gain a dedicated
// R8G8B8A8_UNORM storage alias view when the M2d swapchain-format policy aliased the
// image into the B,G,R,A or sRGB family: a STORAGE_IMAGE descriptor's view format must
// EXACTLY equal the shader's qualifier (rgba8), SPIR-V has no B,G,R,A storage format at
// all, and the mutable-format 4x8 compatibility class makes the alias legal. Sampling
// and attachment views are untouched.
//
// Capability reporting is honest and upstream-visible: GetBackendNameUVE() says
// "Vulkan (M5b storage images)" on dynamic-rendering devices, "Vulkan (M2c textures+staging)"
// on classic ones — never "Vulkan" unqualified — so logs, editor overlays, and bug reports
// cannot mistake the current slice for the finished backend, and IsUsableUVE() reflects the
// real instance/device/swapchain bring-up result.
