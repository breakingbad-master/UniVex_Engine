/// RaycastSystem, InputSystem, GamepadInputSystem, MobileInputSystem, MobileGestureSystem, AudioDevice, AudioSystem, AudioSourceSystem,
/// SaveGameSystem, CheckpointManager, ConfigManager) and drives the canonical
/// engine lifecycle: Init -> Load -> N x (BeginFrame -> Update -> LateUpdate
/// -> Render -> EndFrame) -> Shutdown. Render() calls Renderer3DUVE::RenderFrameUVE()
/// (extract -> cull -> sort -> record -> submit) whenever
/// SetActiveCameraUVE() has set a valid camera entity; with no active camera
/// set, headless mode retains the no-op trace behavior while a valid window
/// receives a real empty-frame clear and present without creating scene content.
/// Update() runs zero or
/// more fixed PhysicsSystemUVE steps (via Utilities::FixedStepResultUVE)
/// before SceneGraphUVE::UpdateUVE() each frame — entirely data-driven off
/// which entities have a Rigid3DComponentUVE/ColliderComponentUVE, so a
/// scene with none behaves exactly as it did before Increment 15, no opt-in
/// needed. RaycastSystemUVE (Increment 16) is a stateless, on-demand query
/// service — like CameraSystem/MeshRenderer, it has no Update()-loop hook
/// of its own; callers reach it via GetServicesUVE().GetRaycastSystemUVE().
/// GamepadInputSystemUVE and MobileInputSystemUVE are committed before InputSystemUVE, so its
/// existing gamepad-aware action bindings read current device snapshots; MobileGestureSystemUVE
/// consumes the committed mobile snapshot after the mobile service update. All three are
/// backend-neutral and own no platform APIs. InputSystemUVE (Increment 17) is stateful and is driven
/// every frame after the device snapshots are committed, so this frame's key/mouse/gamepad edge state
/// and action-triggered events are settled before the fixed-timestep accumulator, event dispatch, or
/// physics steps that follow it in the same call. AudioSourceSystemUVE/AudioSystemUVE
/// (Increment 18) are driven from LateUpdate(): if SetActiveCameraUVE() has
/// set a valid camera, the audio listener is synced to that camera entity's
/// WorldTransformComponentUVE first (the spec's "AudioListenerUVE — Attached
/// to Camera3D by default"); then AudioSourceSystemUVE::SyncUVE() walks every
/// WorldTransformComponentUVE + AudioSourceComponentUVE entity (entirely
/// data-driven, like PhysicsSystemUVE — a scene with none is a cheap no-op);
/// then AudioSystemUVE::UpdateUVE() recomputes attenuated gain for every live
/// source. ComputeSystemUVE (Part 7.2's engine-level compute consumer) is driven from
/// Render(), as its FIRST statement: any dispatch enqueued on it during this
/// frame is recorded into its own command buffer and submitted BEFORE the
/// renderer opens a single render pass - compute first, graphics after, which
/// is the portable flow the RHI compute slices settled on (Vulkan forbids
/// dispatch inside a rendering instance). A frame with an empty queue submits
/// nothing at all, so scenes that never use compute pay nothing observable.
/// WindowManagerUVE/GlRenderDeviceUVE (Increment 20): unless
/// EngineConfigUVE::headlessUVE is true (also settable via the `--headless` CLI flag), Init()
/// creates a real GLFW3 window and OpenGL 4.6 Core render device; Update()'s first statement
/// (after InputSystemUVE::UpdateUVE()) pumps window events and checks
/// IWindowManagerUVE::IsCloseRequestedUVE(), calling RequestQuitUVE() when the configured
/// quit-on-last-window-closed policy is enabled; Render() additionally records and presents a small, explicitly temporary demo
/// triangle proving the window/GL pipeline end-to-end — deliberately outside Renderer3DUVE, which
/// still only ever renders into its own offscreen target regardless of windowed mode (see
/// docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md for the full rendering-evolution roadmap this triangle is the first
/// milestone of). If real window/context creation fails, Init() logs UVE_FATAL and falls back to
/// NullWindowManagerUVE/NullRenderDeviceUVE for the rest of this run, and Load() reports failure
/// so RunUVE() shuts down cleanly instead of proceeding into a broken windowed session. If a
/// context exists but the required OpenGL entry points cannot be loaded, Init() treats that as a
/// recoverable backend-selection failure and selects NullRenderDeviceUVE before shader/frame code
/// runs. A CPU-only build (without desktop GLFW/OpenGL) compiles EngineCoreUVE with the null window
/// and render backends; a requested windowed startup warns and continues headlessly.
/// CheckpointManagerUVE (Increment 19) is driven from Update()'s final statement:
/// UpdateUVE(deltaTime, entityManager, every SceneGraphUVE::GetChildrenUVE(kInvalidEntityUVE)
/// root) accumulates elapsed time and, once the configured
/// EngineConfigUVE::autoSaveIntervalSecondsUVE elapses, saves the whole scene to
/// Save::kAutoSaveSlotIndexUVE via the composed SaveGameSystemUVE — entirely data-driven, like
/// PhysicsSystemUVE/AudioSourceSystemUVE, so an empty scene with the default 300-second interval
/// never actually writes to disk during a short test run. ShaderManagerUVE (Increment 21) is
/// constructed right after RenderDevice, in both headless and windowed mode (it works identically
/// against NullRenderDeviceUVE/GlRenderDeviceUVE); Init() mounts
/// EngineConfigUVE::shaderSourceRealDirectoryUVE under shaderSourceMountPrefixUVE first, so the
/// built-in `.glsl` files resolve through the VFS. Update() calls ShaderManagerUVE::UpdateUVE()
/// every frame (draining background preprocessing, compiling/linking on the main thread, and
/// polling hot-reload) alongside the existing HotReloadUVE/AssetManagerUVE maintenance calls. The
/// demo triangle above now loads its program from the `basic_3d.glsl` built-in via
/// ShaderManagerUVE::CreateProgramUVE() instead of an inline GLSL string; since compilation is
/// asynchronous, the triangle may not actually draw until a frame or two after Init() — Render()
/// guards the draw call on ShaderProgramUVE::IsValidUVE(), so the window's clear color still
/// appears immediately regardless.
/// Thread-safety: not thread-safe. Every method here is intended to be
/// called from a single "engine" thread. The services EngineCoreUVE owns
/// each document their own thread-safety contract independently (e.g.
/// LoggerUVE is safe to log to from other threads even though
