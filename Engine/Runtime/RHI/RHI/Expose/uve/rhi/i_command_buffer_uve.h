/// ICommandBufferUVE is a **retained** command buffer (per the approved architecture decision):
/// a caller records a sequence of render-pass/bind/draw calls into it, then hands the finished
/// object to IRenderDeviceUVE::SubmitUVE() as a batch — mirroring Vulkan/D3D12/Metal's explicit
/// command-list model (the spec's actual named target backends) rather than issuing draw calls
/// immediately as the scene is walked. Obtained via IRenderDeviceUVE::CreateCommandBufferUVE(),
/// never constructed directly.
/// Thread-safety: a single command-buffer instance is recorded by ONE thread and handed to
/// SubmitUVE() exactly once; recording the same instance from multiple threads concurrently, or
/// reusing it after submission, is undefined. Parallel recording ACROSS threads, however, is
/// real as of M4: N threads may each create, record, and submit their OWN instances
/// concurrently — the Vulkan backend's command buffers carry no device state at all and its
/// submission FIFO is mutex-guarded (SubmitUVE is callable from any thread; PresentUVE drains
/// the FIFO in submission order, main-thread), and the Null backend keeps the same discipline
/// for its spy list. That makes the "one recording stream per worker, merged at submission"
/// pattern available today. The GL backend executes every command during recording (an
/// inherent GL-context property), so GL recording stays bound to the context thread.
