// ---- Utility AI --------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// NPC decision-making as scoring, not scripting: every action states what it wants through
// considerations ("flee wants low health, scored steeply"), each frame every action is scored
// against the blackboard, and the best one wins. A blackboard is working memory - floats the game,
// scripts, and (once it lands) perception write; a brain is the scored action set that reads it.
//
// SCORING, STATED ONCE. An action's score is its base score times every consideration's score
// raised to its weight: a zero anywhere vetoes the action, a weight of zero ignores that
// consideration, and higher weights sharpen it. Inputs read 0..1 (clamped); a consideration the
// board does not feed reads zero and vetoes under product scoring - feed everything your actions
// read. Selection keeps the incumbent unless a challenger beats its FRESH score by more than the
// hysteresis, which is what stops an NPC dithering between two equally-scored actions. When
// nothing scores above zero, nothing is selected: an NPC with no valid action does nothing rather
// than a zero-scored something.
